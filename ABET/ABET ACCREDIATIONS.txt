CRITERIA FOR ACCREDITING ENGINEERING PROGRAMS
Effective for Reviews during the 2022-2023 Accreditation Cycle

Introduction
These criteria apply to all accredited engineering programs. Furthermore, these criteria are intended to foster the systematic pursuit of improvement in the quality of engineering education that satisfies the needs of its constituencies in a dynamic and competitive environment. It is the responsibility of the institution seeking accreditation of an engineering program to demonstrate clearly that the program meets the following criteria.
This document contains three sections:
The first section includes important definitions.
The second section contains the General Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs that must be satisfied by all programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET and the General Criteria for Master’s Level Programs that must be satisfied by those programs seeking advanced level accreditation.
The third section contains the Program Criteria that must be satisfied by certain programs. The applicable Program Criteria are determined by the technical specialties indicated by the title of the program. Overlapping requirements need to be satisfied only once.

Definitions
While ABET recognizes and supports the prerogative of institutions to adopt and use the terminology of their choice, it is necessary for ABET volunteers and staff to have a consistent understanding of terminology. With that purpose in mind, the Commissions will use the following basic definitions:
Program Educational Objectives – Program educational objectives are broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years after graduation. Program educational objectives are based on the needs of the program’s constituencies.
Student Outcomes – Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.
Assessment – Assessment is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to evaluate the attainment of student outcomes. Effective assessment uses relevant direct, indirect, quantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate to the outcome being measured. Appropriate sampling methods may be used as part of an assessment process.
 
Evaluation – Evaluation is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence accumulated through assessment processes. Evaluation determines the extent to which student outcomes are being attained. Evaluation results in decisions and actions regarding program improvement.
The Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET recognizes that its constituents may consider certain terms to have certain meanings; however, it is necessary for the Engineering Accreditation Commission to have consistent terminology. Thus, the Engineering Accreditation Commission will use the following definitions in applying the criteria:
Basic Science – Basic sciences are disciplines focused on knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of natural phenomena. Basic sciences consist of chemistry and physics and other natural sciences including life, earth, and space sciences.
College-Level Mathematics – College-level mathematics consists of mathematics that requires a degree of mathematical sophistication at least equivalent to that of introductory calculus. For illustrative purposes, some examples of college-level mathematics include calculus, differential equations, probability, statistics, linear algebra, and discrete mathematics.
Complex Engineering Problems – Complex engineering problems include one or more of the following characteristics: involving wide-ranging or conflicting technical issues, having no obvious solution, addressing problems not encompassed by current standards and codes, involving diverse groups of stakeholders, including many component parts or sub-problems, involving multiple disciplines, or having significant consequences in a range of contexts.
Engineering Design – Engineering design is a process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs and specifications within constraints. It is an iterative, creative, decision-making process in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources into solutions. Engineering design involves identifying opportunities, developing requirements, performing analysis and synthesis, generating multiple solutions, evaluating solutions against requirements, considering risks, and making trade- offs, for the purpose of obtaining a high-quality solution under the given circumstances. For illustrative purposes only, examples of possible constraints include accessibility, aesthetics, codes, constructability, cost, ergonomics, extensibility, functionality, interoperability, legal considerations, maintainability, manufacturability, marketability, policy, regulations, schedule, standards, sustainability, or usability.
Engineering Science – Engineering sciences are based on mathematics and basic sciences but carry knowledge further toward creative application needed to solve engineering problems. These studies provide a bridge between mathematics and basic sciences on the one hand and engineering practice on the other.
 
Team – A team consists of more than one person working toward a common goal and should include individuals of diverse backgrounds, skills, or perspectives.

General Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs - Definitions

That the following definitions for the terms of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, as adopted by the ABET Board of Directors, be incorporated in the definitions of the General Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs.
Inclusion is the intentional, proactive, and continuing efforts and practices in which all members respect, support, and value others. An inclusive environment provides equitable access to opportunities and resources, empowers everyone to participate equally, and offers respect in words and actions for all.
Diversity is the range of human differences, encompassing the characteristics that make one individual or group different from another. Diversity includes, but is not limited to, the following characteristics: race, ethnicity, culture, gender identity and expression, age, national origin, religious beliefs, work sector, physical ability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, language, physical appearance, and cognitive differences.
Equity is the fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement for all people, achieved by intentional focus on their disparate needs, conditions, and abilities. Achieving equity requires understanding of historical and systemic patterns of disparity to address and eliminate barriers and remove participation gaps as part of a comprehensive strategy to achieve equitable outcomes and social justice.
 
General Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs Criterion 5. Curriculum
The curriculum requirements specify subject areas appropriate to engineering, but do not prescribe specific courses. The program curriculum must provide adequate content for each area, consistent with the student outcomes and program educational objectives, to ensure that students are prepared to enter the practice of engineering.
